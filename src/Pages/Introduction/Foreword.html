<h1>What are Actors?</h1>

<h2>Tables Within Tables Within...</h2>

<p>An Actor is the most basic unit of StepMania scripting.  Virtually everything else that you work with in SM5 Lua, be it a Sprite, a BitmapText, or an ActorMultiVertex, is built on top of the foundation that Actor provides.</p>

<p>From a scripter&#8217;s perspective, an Actor is a Lua table with a few special properties that the StepMania engine will look for.  Other StepMania elements that derive from Actor are also really just Lua tables as well.</p>

<p>So if you are familiar with <em>ActorFrames</em>, the StepMania element that serves as a container for manipulating multiple Actors simultaneously within itself, you can start to appreciate how an ActorFrame is a table that contains Actors which are tables.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s tables all the way down.</p>

<h2>Types of Actors</h2>

<p>There are 43 specialized types of Actors available to StepMania&#8217;s Lua scripting interface.  Each type has unique methods available to it and a unique use-case.  For example,</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>Quad</code> actors are quadrilaterals that you can programmatically manipulate</li>
	<li><code>BitmapText</code> actors are used to draw text to the screen</li>
	<li><code>ActorMultiVertex</code> actors are arbitrary polygons that you can programmatically manipulate</li>
	<li><code>Sprite</code> actors are used to load visual assets like png images or avi movies</li>
	<li><code>ActorFrame</code> actors serve as containers for other actors, and are useful when you want to manipulate a group of actors simultaneously, rather than individually</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>An Example SM5 Lua Script</h2>

<p>The most commonly used Actors will each be discussed in detail in the chapters under <strong>Actors</strong> in the navigation menu.  For now, we&#8217;ll start by looking at a simple Lua script for StepMania 5.</p>


<span class="CodeExample-Title">A Simple SM5 Lua Script:</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- start by defining an ActorFrame
-- call it ExampleAF (example ActorFrame)
local ExampleAF = Def.ActorFrame{
   OnCommand=function(self)
      self:Center():sleep(9999)
   end,

   -- since Actors are just Lua tables
   -- we can nest them directly inside
   -- the parent ActorFrame table like this
   Def.Quad{
      InitCommand=function(self)
         self:zoomto(50,137)
      end
   },

   -- note that since these are elements in
   -- a Lua table, everything is comma-delimited
   Def.BitmapText{
      Font="Common Normal",
      Text="Eat Poptarts."
   }
}


-- since ExampleAF is an indexed Lua table, we can also
-- add elements to its next index externally like this:
ExampleAF[#ExampleAF + 1] = Def.Sprite{
   Texture="chrismarks.png"
}

-- Every Lua Theme/BGCHANGE/FGCHANGE file in SM5 must return some
-- sort of Actor. Typically, we end up returning an ActorFrame.
return ExampleAF
</code></pre>


<h2>Only one Actor can be returned per file.</h2>

<p>The StepMania engine expects one Actor to be returned per Lua file, yet the example above features four Actors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 ActorFrame</li>
	<li>1 Quad</li>
	<li>1 BitmapText</li>
	<li>1 Sprite</li>
</ul>

<p>How do we make this work?</p>

<p>The solution reveals a prominent design paradigm in StepMania scripting â€“ put all other Actors inside the ActorFrame and return the ActorFrame.  An ActorFrame is just one type of Actor, and any valid Actor may be returned.</p>

<p>If your Lua file is <em>very</em> simple, you may only have one Actor, maybe a Sprite or a Quad.  In such situations, it is not necessary to wrap the single Actor in an ActorFrame; <em>any valid StepMania Actor may be returned.</em></p>

<p>Still, most files end up being complex enough to warrant using an ActorFrame.</p>
