<h1>Model</h1>

<p class="alert alert-info"><em>This article was graciously contributed by <a href="https://github.com/JoseVarelaP">JoseVarelaP</a>!</em></p>

<p>
	<em>Model</em> is an actor class used to load 3D models into StepMania 5.  At this time, StepMania 5 only supports one format: <strong><em>MilkShape 3D ASCII</em></strong>.  This means that modeling must be done using the MilkShape 3D software which is only for Windows OS.
</p>

<p>Let&apos;s start by looking at a very simple example:</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Simple Def.Model Example</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
Def.Model {
   Meshes="MyModel.txt",
   Materials="MyModel.txt",
   Bones="MyModel.txt",
   OnCommand=function(self)
      self:Center()
   end,
}
</code></pre>

<p>
	This example will load a plaintext file named <code>MyModel.txt</code> that was exported from MilkShape 3D in the <em>MilkShape 3D ASCII</em> format.  That single file will contain all the data needed to for a <code>Def.Model</code>, including the <code>Meshes</code>, <code>Materials</code>, and <code>Bones</code>.
</p>


<h3>Meshes, Materials, and Bones</h3>

<p><strong>Meshes</strong> are the composition and structure of the <code>Model</code>.  This data represents the vertices that make the <code>Model</code> take shape.</p>

<p><strong>Materials</strong> are the textures that the model will use. These can be any of the image formats listed in the <a data-component="Link" href="/Introduction/Supported-File-Extensions">Supported File Extensions</a> page. They can also be <em>.ini</em> files that define animated textures on a <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/Sprite">Def.Sprite</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bones</strong> make the model come to life. They can be defined within the primary model file, or, in the case of dancing characters, be controlled via a separate file that only contains the bones.</p>

<p>In the above example, all three attributes used the same filepath; all the necessary data was contained within a single file.  It is possible to configure the MilkShape 3D software to output distinct files for meshes, materials, and bones, and set each <code>Def.Model</code> attribute accordingly, but that is outside the scope of this lesson.</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">All three attributes <strong>must</strong> be provided within <code>Def.Model</code> as paths to resources that can be loaded or StepMania will crash.</p>

<p>If you wish to load the <code>Model</code> without having to add bones, use <a data-component="Link" href="/Actors/LoadActor">LoadActor()</a> instead.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using LoadActor() to Make Life Easier</span>
<pre><code class="lua">LoadActor("MyModel.txt")..{
   OnCommand=function(self) self:Center() end
}
</code></pre>




<h3>Dancing Character Models</h3>
<p>While dancing characters typically appear in ScreenGameplay, it is possible to load them into any screen using <code>Def.Model</code>.  The following example can be used to load a randomly selected dancing character into the scene.</p>


<span class="CodeExample-Title">Random Dancing Character</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- This will load a random character from SM5's ./Characters folder

-- acquire a handle on a single, randomly selected
-- dancing character using CHARMAN
local CharacterToLoad = CHARMAN:GetRandomCharacter()

Def.Model {
   Meshes=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   Materials=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   Bones=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   OnCommand=function(self)
      self:Center()
   end,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Wait a second - why is the model so far away?</p>


<p>This is caused by how most 3D modelers have made their models to function with the corresponding <em>DDR-PC bones</em>, which are the most commonly used bones for dancing characters in StepMania.  As a result, dancing characters typically appear tiny when used outside of gameplay.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is how the model is presented by default â€“ it&apos;s facing away from us, the viewer.  This behavior can be changed by rotating on the <code>y</code> axis and explicitly setting a <code>z</code> value.</p>


<span class="CodeExample-Title">Random Dancing Character, Better</span>
<pre><code class="lua">-- acquire a handle on a single, randomly selected
-- dancing character using CHARMAN
local CharacterToLoad = CHARMAN:GetRandomCharacter()

Def.Model {
   Meshes=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   Materials=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   Bones=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- Set the model's y rotation to accommodate our vantage point
      -- and apply a z that will get the model closer to the camera.
      self:Center():rotationy(180):z(300)
   end,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, that&apos;s closer, but it still doens&apos;t look like the dancing character from gameplay!</p>

<p>There&apos;s one additional "gotcha" regarding model animations in StepMania&apos;s dancing characters.  They are not handled by or defined within the model, but rather the <em>bones</em>.  To add animations to the model, pass the <code>Bones</code> attribute of the <code>Def.Model</code> a dedicated bones file.</p>


<span class="CodeExample-Title">Random Dancing Character, Fixed</span>
<pre><code class="lua">-- acquire a handle on a single, randomly selected
-- dancing character using CHARMAN
local CharacterToLoad = CHARMAN:GetRandomCharacter()

Def.Model {
   Meshes=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   Materials=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),

   -- For this example, we'll provide a path to a dedicated bones file
   -- by using SM5's Character GetRestAnimationPath() method
   -- for this example, we'll use the Rest Animation
   Bones=CharacterToLoad:GetRestAnimationPath(),

   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- Set the model's y rotation to accommodate our vantage point
      -- and apply a z that will get the model closer to the camera.
      self:Center():rotationy(180):z(300)

      -- since we're using the rest animation, we'll want to also set
      -- the y() position to be lower on on the screen
      self:addy(10)
   end
}
</code></pre>


<p><img alt="" class="img-fluid" src="/lua-for-itgmania/img/Model-WithBones.png" /></p>


<p>As a final note, some models may have inverted vertexes, which can cause some polygons to collide with one another and draw in the wrong order. To fix this, set the model&apos;s <code>Cull Mode</code> to <code>none</code>.</p>


<span class="CodeExample-Title">Random Dancing Character, CullMode None</span>
<pre><code class="lua">-- acquire a handle on a single, randomly selected
-- dancing character using CHARMAN
local CharacterToLoad = CHARMAN:GetRandomCharacter()

Def.Model {
   Meshes=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),
   Materials=CharacterToLoad:GetModelPath(),

   Bones=CharacterToLoad:GetRestAnimationPath(),

   OnCommand=function(self)
      -- Set the model's y rotation to accommodate our vantage point
      -- and apply a z that will get the model closer to the camera.
      self:Center():rotationy(180):z(300)

      -- since we're using the rest animation, we'll want to also set
      -- the y() position to be lower on on the screen
      self:addy(10)

      -- finally, set the Cull Mode to none
      self:cullmode("CullMode_None")
   end
}
</code></pre>
