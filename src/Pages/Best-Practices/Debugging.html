<h1>Debugging</h1>

<p>Using <a data-component="Link" href="/Singletons/SCREENMAN">SCREENMAN</a>&apos;s <code>SystemMessage()</code> method may perhaps be the most tried-and-true means of quickly displaying debugging output to the Screen.  <code>SystemMessage()</code> accepts a string as an argument and displays it at the top of the screen for a few seconds.</p>

<p>Let&apos;s jump into a simple example from ScreenGameplay where we listen for and print out JudgmentMessages.  A <em>Judgment</em> is how each step is evaluated as it passes in Gameplay.  Each Judgment has a corresponding JudgmentMessage broadcast by the engine that contains information about that Judgment.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using SystemMessage() to print debug output</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
-- Since the engine only broadcasts JudgmentMessages to ScreenGameplay,
-- this example only makes sense and does anything in ScreenGameplay.

return Def.Actor{
   JudgmentMessageCommand=function(self, params)
      -- Note that JudgementMessages will be broadcast for any human players,
      -- but to keep this example simple, we'll limit it to PLAYER_1.
      if params.Player == PLAYER_1 then

         -- This SystemMessage will display each judgment in string
         -- form at the top of the screen as it occurs.
         -- So, if a note passes and the player misses it,
         -- "TapNoteScore_Miss"  would be displayed at the
         -- top of the screen.
         --
         -- A W1 judgment (Marvelous in DDR, Fantastic in ITG, etc.)
         -- would display "TapNoteScore_W1".
         -- (Note that the "W" is for window, as in "timing window.")
         --
         -- Hold notes have their own, separate judgment system.
         -- So, when a hold note is judged, a JudgmentMessage will be
         -- broadcast, but the TapNoteScore parameter will be nil.
         -- Account for that here with a logical or statement that tries
         -- params.HoldNoteScore if params.TapNoteScore is nil.
         SCREENMAN:SystemMessage( params.TapNoteScore or params.HoldNoteScore )
      end
   end
}

<h3>Using SystemMessage() to display Table output</h3>

<p><code>SystemMessage()</code> displays strings, not tables, so if in our debugging endeavors we want such functionality, we&apos;ll have to enhance SystemMessage some with custom Lua.  The <em>Simply Love</em> theme for SM5 <a href="https://github.com/Simply-Love/Simply-Love-SM5/blob/master/Scripts/06%20SL-Utilities.lua">includes some helper functions</a>.  As the author of that theme, I encourage you to use that code in your own scripting/theming endeavors.  One way to do this is to include a copy of <strong>SL-Utilities.lua</strong> in the <em>./Scripts</em> directory of your current theme.</p>

<p>The function defined in <strong>SL-Utilities.lua</strong> that is relevant here is <code>SM()</code>  which is short for SystemMessage.  Assuming that SL-Utilities.lua is copied into the current theme&apos;s Scripts directory and loaded (by restarting StepMania or pressing <kbd>Control</kbd> <kbd>F2</kbd>), this example will print table of the which steps were just judged in a JudgmentMessage.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using SM() to display a small Lua table</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
return Def.Actor{
   JudgmentMessageCommand=function(self, params)
      -- Again, limit to  PLAYER_1 for a more simple example.
      if params.Player == PLAYER_1 then
         -- SystemMessage a stringified table of note columns
         -- as each judgment occurs
         SM( params.Notes )
      end
   end
}
</code></pre>

<p>The screenshot below shows that columns 4 and 1 (a left-right jump) were just missed.</p>

<h3>Knowing when to use Trace()</h3>

<p>Please note that <code>SystemMessage()</code> is not the only debugging tool available in StepMania.  SystemMessage() actually has a rather limited usefulness because large Lua tables can easily contain more data than StepMania&apos;s window can reasonably display.  In such situations, a proper Lua <code>Trace()</code> is preferred.  Output from <code>Trace()</code> is written to <em>Logs/Log.txt</em></p>

<p>StepMania&apos;s <em>_fallback</em> theme includes a  <code>rec_print_table()</code> function to assist with recursively printing deeply nested Lua tables to the Log.txt file.  Here is the example from above, reworked to to use <code>rec_print_table()</code> to write the entire params table to file.</p>

<span class="CodeExample-Title">Using rec_print_table() to log a large Lua table</span>
<pre><code class="lua">
return Def.Actor{
   JudgmentMessageCommand=function(self, params)
      -- recursive print the entire table of JudgmentMessage parameters
      -- to Logs/Log.txt.  This would be more information than could fit
      -- onscreen at a single moment.
      rec_print_table( params )
   end
}
</code></pre>
